## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itslaks/SkillTest_AI.git
cd SkillTest_AI
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables — `.env.local`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key      # optional but recommended
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key      # optional fallback

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Database Setup

Run these SQL scripts **in order** in your Supabase SQL editor:

```
scripts/001_create_profiles.sql
scripts/002_create_quizzes.sql
scripts/003_create_questions.sql
scripts/004_create_attempts.sql
scripts/005_create_gamification.sql
scripts/006_create_triggers.sql
scripts/007_seed_badges.sql
scripts/008_add_passing_score.sql
scripts/009_create_quiz_assignments.sql
scripts/010_fix_leaderboard_rls.sql
scripts/011_fix_manager_rls.sql
scripts/012_create_assessment_imports.sql
```

### 4. Create a Manager Account

```bash
node scripts/seed_admin.js
```

### 5. Start Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

---

## Database Schema

```
profiles           role, employee_id, department, domain
quizzes            title, topic, difficulty, time_limit, passing_score
questions          MCQ options linked to quizzes
quiz_attempts      score, answers, time_taken, points_earned
quiz_assignments   manager-to-employee quiz links
user_stats         total_points, streak, tests_completed
user_badges        earned badge records
badges             name, description, points, criteria
assessment_imports AI import history
```

---

## Quiz Assignment Flow

```
Manager creates quiz
       |
Manager assigns quiz to employee(s) via Employees page
       |
Employee logs in — sees only their assigned quizzes
       |
Employee completes quiz — points, badges, streak updated automatically
       |
Manager views results in Leaderboard / Reports
```

---

## AI Question Generation

Three-tier fallback system:

```
1. OpenAI GPT-4o-mini       Primary (fastest, best quality)
        |
        v (if unavailable or quota exceeded)
2. Google Gemini 1.5 Flash  Secondary fallback
        |
        v (if unavailable)
3. Template Engine           Always available — no API key needed
```

**Generation modes:**

- **Topic-based** — generate questions from a subject/topic name
- **Content-based** — upload PDF/DOCX or paste text, AI extracts questions
- **Excel import** — bulk import pre-written questions from `.xlsx`

---

## Security & Scalability

| Concern | Implementation |
|:--------|:--------------|
| Authentication | Supabase Auth with JWT tokens |
| Authorisation | Row Level Security (RLS) on every table |
| Role Enforcement | Server-side role check — cannot be bypassed via client |
| Input Validation | Zod schemas on all server actions and API routes |
| Rate Limiting | Vercel Edge middleware |
| XSS Prevention | React's built-in escaping + sanitised inputs |
| SQL Injection | Parameterised queries via Supabase client |
| Secrets | Environment variables only — never exposed to client |
| Admin Operations | Service role key used server-side only for leaderboard aggregation |

---

## Gamification System

| Element | How It Works |
|:--------|:------------|
| Points | Earned per correct answer — visible live in the employee nav bar |
| Streak | Days in a row with at least one quiz attempt |
| Badges | Auto-awarded by database triggers on milestones |
| Leaderboard | Ranked by total points — gold podium display for top 3 |
| Progress | Dashboard shows cumulative stats across all attempts |

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|:---------|:---------|:------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anonymous key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Yes | Service role key (server-only) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional | OpenAI key for primary AI generation |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional | Google Gemini key for fallback AI |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Yes | Base URL of your deployment |

---

## NPM Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev      # Start dev server with Turbopack
pnpm build    # Production build
pnpm start    # Start production server
pnpm lint     # Run ESLint
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Employees see no quizzes**
Quizzes must be explicitly assigned via the Employees page in the Manager portal.

**AI question generation fails**
Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set. The template engine is the last resort fallback.

**Leaderboard shows no data**
Run `scripts/010_fix_leaderboard_rls.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.

**VS Code CSS warnings** (`@apply`, `@theme`, `@custom-variant`)
These are valid Tailwind v4 syntax — not errors. The `.vscode/settings.json` in this repo already suppresses them.

**Manager cannot see employee attempts**
Run `scripts/011_fix_manager_rls.sql` to fix RLS policies.
